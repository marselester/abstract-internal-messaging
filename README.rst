==================================
Abstract Internal Messaging System
==================================

This is an interview test task.

.. note::
    It is used as example Django project in
    `Developing Django project with SaltStack`_,
    `Developing & Deploying Django project with SaltStack`_,
    `Deploy Abstract Internal Messaging System`_.

Allow sending of messages between individual users, identified by the unique
key of their record in the system. Messages are in markdown format, and
auto-complete of recipients would be a bonus.

Allow a user to view their inbox, read messages, (automatically) mark messages
as read, and delete messages.

Allow sending a broadcast message to all users. Keep in mind that there could
be millions of users.

Allow sending a message to a group of users. Groups can be large (over 100,000
users) and are stored by having each user record list all the groups itâ€™s a
member of. Group membership varies over time and a message should be received
only by the users who were members of the destination group at the time the
message was sent.
